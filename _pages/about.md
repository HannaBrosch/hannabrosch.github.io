Hi! I am a PhD student at [the Technical University of Munich](https://www.mgt.tum.de/global-center-for-family-enterprise/prof-dr-philipp-lergetporer), interested in Gender and Labor Economics, Education, and Behavioral Economics.

I’m always open to discussions about my research - feel free to reach out!

From October to December 2024, I will be a visiting PhD student at Stanford Graduate School of Education, supported by a DAAD scholarship.
